title: Thoughts on Sales Engineering in the Tech Industry

excerpt: "An SE role is multi-dimensional. You need strong technical skills, but without an equally established non-technical skillset, those technical skills will not be put to use effectively."
---
One of the most interesting roles in tech companies is the Pre-Sales Engineer, often called a Sales Engineer (SE), though that title is now shifting heavily towards a Technical Solutions Architect (TSA). Some call it a Systems Engineer (SE) which ends up being more confusing since that exact title is used for System Administrators sometimes. Another title that’s popping up here and there is Customer Engineer (CE). Personally, I like the SE and TSA titles. TSA in particular gives the indication that It’s a technology role that focused on selling a suite of products that can make up a larger solution as opposed to selling point products, while the SE can be any sales engineering role, like a B2B mechanical pre-sales engineer. I’ll stick to SE in this article.

I write to share my experience as an SE in more detail. I’ll go over the tasks that an SE can take and clarify this role for anyone that’s interested. I’ll steer away from going deep into technical skills since those vary from one company to company, product to another.

An SE role is multi-dimensional. You need strong technical skills, but without an equally established non-technical skillset, those technical skills will not be put to use effectively. SEs vary in what skills they’re focused on primarily growing. Some are deeply technical and tend to steer away from the pure sales meetings and tasks, some tend to play in the middle, while some seem to put their focus more on the non-technical skills. I believe that this focus sways with the person’s life and career stages. Sometimes you’ll need to learn a whole new world of technology and need to invest your time in growing technically, especially that technology is still rapidly changing. If you’ve hit a level of technical aptitude you’re satisfied with, you might focus on the non-technical skillset, and If you’re happy with both, I guess you’re busy responding to recruiters and helping others.

Non-technical skills, in my opinion, are what shape your career and give you unique value. Any engineer can gain the technical skills needed for the job with effort, discipline, and time. And it’s not uncommon to see more technical resources remain in customer support or system administration roles. It’s your responsibility to grow your career. It’s your responsibility to know your destination and your skill gap to get there. The non-technical skills are harder to gain and harder to quantify, thus, harder to find.

Before I move on, I’d like to emphasize that a Sales Engineer is a salesperson. I know many SEs come from prior pure engineering or product roles and still have that mindset. You have to accept the fact that you are a salesperson, no different at all from your pure sales colleagues. Selling is your career now, leveraging your engineering skills.

So, let’s break non-technical skills down a bit into groups. For each group, I’ll share some thoughts and quotes, and recommend some books.

**1. Emotional Intelligence**: Mostly revolves around self-awareness, self-regulation, mindfulness, empathy, and social skills.

I’d personally say this is the most impactful skill set to possess. Not only professionally, but in all aspects of life. Emotional Intelligence (EI) is maturity. It’s the key to happiness and peace.

**2. Sales & Marketing**: These two go hand-in-hand; they’re bound together. In tech, sales is about leading a change in the industry. Product and Engineering build a product, Sales & Marketing make sure it’s put to use.

Sales is a lifestyle. I believe, in sales, there’s no work-life balance. Work-Life Balance is a valid concept when you have a job. You do your 9–5 then try to leave it behind the rest of the day while you run the rest of your life. Sales is a career, not a job. Your life and your career are tied together. They succeed together, and suffer together. To be a good salesperson, you need to be in a healthy mindset. That probably means having healthy relationships with your family & friends, a healthy diet, a healthy positive outlook on life, not having any serious unresolved issues in your life, because you can’t hide those when you’re building a truly successful sales territory. Sure, there are average salespeople who hit their numbers and live a good life, but the goal is to be successful while enjoying it and feeling gratification from your career, and that approach requires harmony between the two sections of your life; career and everything outside of it.

Under sales, I’ll also bundle goal setting. Running reports on the dataset available in your CRM on your territory and defining clear goals to focus on is a crucial part of growing the territory and being specific about what success means in numbers and figures. Google’s Objectives & Key Results (OKRs) is the most well-defined approach to goal-setting I’ve come across.

Marketing will vary with the products you’re selling. Perhaps as a salesperson, you don’t feel personally in charge of marketing, especially that there’s a whole organization full of marketers, but the reality is understanding how marketing functions will help you market your specific needs to your territory and key customers, which helps you close sales.

It’s ok to leave the bigger marketing initiatives such as brand management and audience marketing to marketers, but you can at least tailor content to your specific territory, run webinars, host regional events, participate in conferences, and present as much as possible.

**3. Business**: The ability to truly understand how a business functions as an organization. Different sizes and verticals have their own methods of operations and success factors. It’s crucial to understand the vertical(s) you support.

Needless to say, the business stands on top of finance and economics. In all cases, finance, economics, and investing are beneficial for anyone interested in building wealth; it’s worth investing your time to learn and practice these in particular.

To make a large impact on your customers, invest time to learn what drives their business at the core, their growth factors, and the industry’s overall direction. SEs frequently speak to directors and executives, and the ability to see the world from their point of view is crucial to communicate with them and speak to their needs.

I would argue that the above breakdown applies to most roles that have some executive responsibility. What I mean is that in sales, you own a territory. Your actions determine your success. It’s like managing a franchise in a way. Once you accept that your attitude and actions impact your performance and income, you’ll start growing on all the above skills to match your role’s requirements and your own personal goals.

## Growing as a Sales Engineer
In terms of growth as an SE, perhaps it’s good to break down seniority levels into three buckets. Associate, Senior, and Lead. Real-world levels will have many grades and more titles, but the idea remains the same (low, medium, high).

### Associate
- Partner with one or more sales teams or account managers
- Acting as the technical lead for the covered territory
- Likely to follow the sales account manager’s lead in the territory, and act as a go-to technical advisor
- Train sellers (sales and SE resources) in any organization/team that could impact revenue generation (eg: partners, channel)
- Manage post-sales requirements when they impact customer satisfaction, especially when issues jeopardize the pipeline
- Present frequently at meetings and conferences

### Senior
- Partner with an account manager or more. Probably less than 3
- Acting as the technical lead for the covered territory
- Deeper technical understanding of the technology than associate level
- Play a bigger role in driving the business: relationship management, initiating marketing events, presenting frequently, and influencing the territory strategy. Ownership of the territory in partnership with the sales counterpart(s)
- When faced with a challenging technical opportunity, will likely find a workaround or customize a solution to meet requirements that aren’t offered directly by the product
- Play a role in leading a technology or product on a team level or any scope larger than oneself.
Likely to mentor associate SEs.
- Might also play a role in talent acquisition, resource allocation, and other operational functions of the SE organization.
- Ensures the Product Management team is aware of the industry challenges and priorities you see in your own territory.
- Train sellers (sales and SE resources) in any organization/team that could impact revenue generation (eg: partners, channel)
- Manage post-sales requirements when they impact customer satisfaction, especially when issues jeopardize the pipeline.
- Present frequently and efficiently

### Lead
- Play a bigger role in driving the business: relationship management, initiating marketing events, presenting frequently, and influencing the territory strategy. Ownership of the territory in partnership with the sales counterpart(s).
- Potentially, doesn’t own a territory and acts as a technology leader for the organization and for other SEs to leverage.
- Expert technical understanding of the technology.
- Likely, provides deep non-technical industry and vertical expertise that help significantly grow the business.
- Likely to mentor senior SEs.
- When faced with a challenging technical opportunity, will likely find a workaround or customize a solution to meet requirements that aren’t offered directly by the product
- Play a role in leading a technology or product on a wide-range scope, eg: vertical, continent, global.
- Works closely with the Product Management team and the sales organization to help define the product growth and roadmap.
- Train sellers (sales and SE resources) in any organization/team that could impact revenue generation (eg: partners, channel)
- Manage post-sales requirements when they impact customer satisfaction, especially when issues jeopardize the pipeline.
- Present at conferences as a technology leader

Now, let’s take some examples and go over the mindset of an associate vs. senior SE when facing a challenge, and put the above non-technical skills to use.

**Example 01: the company has a public large-scale outage**
Say there’s a major bug that impacts a set of features for all customers. It’s a tough position to be in. Your company has had similar incidents before and long-time customers are losing confidence in your product(s) and your company. How would you handle the situation?

Associate: When a customer of yours is upset, you step in and provide them comfort and provide a genuine response to the incident, assuring them you as a company have learned from this mistake and have taken actions to ensure it doesn’t recur. Assure them your company’s leadership will issue a public response very soon to address the situation.

Senior: Even though you know your company’s leadership will communicate with all customers, you understand that’s not a personal message. You also want to make sure your customers have an easy-to-reach contact for any questions or concerns. You email your key contacts personally with transparency on the situation. Make sure they’re aware of it If they weren’t to avoid them learning about it on the media or news. You continue communicating key updates on the situation. If any of your customers respond harshly, you understand you’re in a better place having reached out because now you have a chance to remediate and help instead of them turning away from you. In summary, you do the right thing for your customers, and at the same time, you leverage this major issue to build trust.

**Example 02: escalation going bad**
Say you have a customer with an escalation that’s been causing them to spend about 5 hours or more every week on manual work due to a product bug. The issue has escalated for over 6 months and your engineering team still hasn’t provided a resolution while the customer frustration is increasing with time. How would you handle the situation?

Associate: You understand this is your responsibility to do all you can for your customer. After all, the engineering team looks at bugs from a global impact point of view, but for you, you need to make sure your customers get a resolution. You bridge communication between the engineering, support, customer success, and the customer contacts, and make sure everyone is pulled in together. You set up periodic meetings to keep the momentum going until the fix is released.

Senior: Though you’re doing everything on the associate level, you also accept that it is not enough. If you want to do the best for your customer and retain them, you need to find a workaround. You get creative. You might find some other products to deploy till the issue is resolved, you might build a custom solution to achieve similar functionality, or you might even find a budget to help take some load off the customers’ hands. In all cases, you understand that this is a moment to go above & beyond and that it’s your own responsibility to find a solution despite you not being the product manager or a software engineer to resolve the issue.

**Example 03: Assigned quota seems unattainable**
Say you close a great year. You’ve overachieved, got paid handsomely, and generated enough pipeline to set the next year up for another record year. Once your company finalizes the next fiscal year’s target goals, you are assigned a significantly larger quota than you expected. The pipeline you’ve been relying on now seems so insufficient. You feel that you can’t reach this new number you’ve been assigned.

Associate: Since you managed to produce significant business growth the year before, you believe that you can do it again this year. You communicate your frustration with your direct manager, and maybe even upper management, but maintain a calm and respectful attitude. You understand your organization is growing rapidly and sometimes you have to set scary goals, and that in the long run, it’ll be worth it. In sales, some years are more challenging, others are great.

Senior: Positivity is a given. Accepting the new large quota is also a given. You don’t show much frustration. You know your leadership is in the same boat you are in; no one is happy with this situation. You don’t let it get to you. Instead, you truly accept it, internalize it, and focus on the changes that need to happen to hit this number and exceed it. This will probably require a change to be made, and change requires intentional leadership and a lot of effort and time. You work with your sales counterpart(s) and identify the top areas to focus on and set clear measurable goals and actions and execute with discipline and continuous monitoring. It will be a challenging year, but it’s also a chance to practice your leadership, emotional intelligence, and communication skills.

## SE Career Progression
There’s a big benefit of staying as an SE in the same industry (or company) for longer durations; you gain seniority. Becoming a lead SE is a gratifying role since you get to make a large impact on the product and industry by cooperating tightly with the Product Management team, as well as making a large impact on the Sales organization and helping evangelize the technology you’re passionate about. Of course, more seniority, higher job grade, higher pay, higher status.

In case staying as an SE isn’t your goal when it comes to the next career step, It’s typically:

- SE Management: good fit if you’re passionate about people management and enjoy being in a sales environment.
- Product: move towards the product side of the house. Either a product specialist, architect or manager. Being on the product side means you make a bigger impact on product growth and a global (if that’s the company’s reach) one.
- Sales: move towards a pure sales function. An Account Manager (AM), Account Executive (AE), or any similar role, including the partner organization.
- Engineering: move towards software engineering If you’re interested in creating solutions and less interested in the sales lifestyle.
An SE is a fun and challenging role, and I see some that remain in that role for the majority of their career. After all, It gets easier with time and takes less effort to perform at the same efficiency level. That way you can keep doing what you enjoy, and invest your time in the other aspects of life (family & friends, hobbies, …etc).
