# On Leadership and Management

I’d like to share some thoughts on these two intertwined topics and distill some of the principles underlying each. You can manage and lead with or without authority from any role. That being said, people management is often assigned while leadership is often natural or assumed. The main  prerequisite to both is learning to manage yourself prior to guiding others. Let’s dive in.

# Foundations of Leadership

Leadership is about initiating and driving change. It focuses on the future and long-term. In many ways leading is intentional and risky requiring proficiency in advocating for the vision you’re promoting. Leadership is much more involved with emotions as compared to management which deals with reason where you typically feel the calamity, maturity, peace and kindness in leaders. There’s a substantial amount of self-regulation and self-control as a precursor to leading others.

An element of leadership is finding novel ways to grow, say a business. This growth more likely culminates in continuously executing small steps rather than large transformational missions. The audacity to rally a group towards a new *shared meaning* in the form of a product, methodology, process, or tool, requires a substantial amount of belief that others need to feel in you as you carry the torch forward. As Bob Iger alludes to in *A Ride of a Lifetime*, leaders require integrity, decisiveness, and optimism. Change requires flexibility to figure it out when the going is tough as opposed to a mindset of doubt and fear that gets people stuck in *analysis paralysis*. 

## Over Communicate

A message of change must be reiterated over and over till It is received by every individual and until they believe in it and adapt their inner talk tracks, behaviors, and mental models to match it. That is a substantial mass of change to bring to life. I remember how in my Cisco Systems days we were all navigating the change from perpetual licensing to subscriptions. It meant thousands of people had to learn a new selling model, new company economics and key KPIs, and a massive community of practitioners in the field had to adjust their knowledge of product licensing. This kind of strategy shift takes years to complete and settle in its new shape. In terms of advocacy, leaders must leverage all the airtime at their disposal from org-wide townhalls and team meetings to ad hoc 1:1s, all to ensure the message is clearly delivered. Think of a change you wanted to make but it didn’t materialize and ask yourself “Did I communicate the change to everyone, multiple times, till they accepted it?”

## Culture Setting

Whether you’re an executive, a manager, or an individual contributor, being foreseen as a leader will require you to voice out your opinions and shine on your personality, and take role in setting team/org culture. The higher you are up the chain, the more people will look towards you to model the kosher and taboo. 

Many teams also function in siloed structures where they only see within the bound walls of their sister teams and org. Think of an engineering team that’s mostly involved in the capabilities they’re building, not frequently interfacing with marketing, sales, support, business development, and other BUs in the company. Such team’s manager serves as the beacon and oracle of organizational knowledge that members follow. The implicit actions they take as team leader demonstrates the primary guidelines this team will follow and will serve a key aspect of how each individual experiences their role and largely affects their employee satisfaction.

## Emotional Assurance

Change naturally drains our emotional and mental capacity. It’s consuming to go through uncertainty without any assurance as to whether the future state will be brighter than the status quo or a path to misery. In that, people look to their leaders for answers. Each of us is adept at sensing body language, tone of speech, and the subtle communication cues to get a realistic read of the situation. This is exactly where leaders must instill hope and maintain a positive outlook to guide their followers.

Besides uncertainty, change also introduces frustration and leaders should anticipate a copious amount of criticism, doubt, fear, pushback, and resistance. It could feel that you’re fighting a battle against coworkers who are in favor of upholding the state of affairs. Meaning, the other emotional intelligence skill to sharpen as a leader is your ability to shrug off doubt and focus on the mission you’re propelling. You almost serve as a sponge to soak up frustrations.  

## Pace Setting

Progressing at the speed of the team is yet another skill a leader must carry. People can only learn and adapt so much so fast. You’re aspiring for a delicate balance. Go too fast and you’ll have people overwhelmed; go to slow and you’ll lose momentum. Once again you find yourself managing emotions at a both a micro- and macro-level. To reiterate, leadership is primarily concerned with emotions

## Form Industry Coalitions

As a thought leader, you serve an industry and a specialization. For that matter, you will be much more effective If you form coalitions and a network that can propel change across organizations requiring you to collaborate in this wider form to influence and push the status quo. This is where attending industry events, speaking at these events if possible, writing publicly, and networking all come in handy. I personally keep a spreadsheet of acquaintances. 

## **Leadership Misconceptions**
You are not expected to lead all the time. It’s natural for thought leaders to go through bouts of sustenance. It’s also acceptable to acknowledge at any time that you don’t have all the answers immediately on the spot and reserve the right to research a subject matter even as a key figure in said field.

Charisma is not a precursor to leadership. It is simply a personality trait. You might not have heard of Mary Barra, Doug Baker, or Shantanu Narayen, but these executives have transformed the companies they lead without becoming a media obsession.

# Foundations of Management

Management is about serving others, managing complexity, and gradual improvements. It focuses on the present and near term.  While leadership is an art of envisioning, management is an art of execution. A manager’s role is not about telling their team what the solution to a problem is, rather guiding them to find answers themselves. As a people manager, you empower, mediate, communicate, and play a key role in defining team culture. Without efficient management, enterprises tend to turn chaotic in ways that reduce their profitability and potentially jeopardize their survival.

## Context Setting

Providing the team with context. the higher you go up the ladder, the broader your view point on the business is, and it’s a manager’s task to distill the top view and relay information to their team in order to fill in the *context gap.* Managers also do the reverse and communicate the teams’ view up, elegantly connecting the dots at their level in the organization hierarchy. 

## People Development

Meet people where they’re at and helping them grow to reach their goals could be the most rewarding aspect of serving a people manager role. It is necessary to understand what drives each individual and whether they’re in a sustenance or hypergrowth phase then empowering them to meet their targets. Depending on the organization and individual, a healthy development plan can be 6-18 months long but nothing longer since opinions can change drastically in 18 months and especially when you’re actively and intentionally working on them.

> To keep a team cohesive, you need both rock stars and superstars. Rock stars are solid as a rock. Think the Rock of Gibraltar, not Bruce Springsteen. The rock stars love their work. They have found their groove. They don’t want the next job if it will take them away from their craft. Not all artists want to own a gallery; in fact, most don’t. If you honor and reward the rock stars, they’ll become the people you most rely on. If you promote them into roles they don’t want or aren’t suited for, however, you’ll lose them—or, even worse, wind up firing them. Superstars, on the other hand, need to be challenged and given new opportunities to grow constantly. — Kim Scott (Radical Candor)

## **Recognition & Celebrating Accomplishments**

In high-performance cultures, we’re never short on things to do and a certain degree of burn out is inevitable. The best managers prioritize people recovery and treat time-off as a per-individual target. Those type-A’s are prone to overworking and deprioritizing rest. Recognition, broadly speaking, covers time-off, public and private acknowledgement, and acts of service/kindness. Think what a difference it makes to acknowledge a late night’s work to meet tight deadlines makes, a $100 gift card for going above & beyond for the team/org, or a written message to senior leadership when an Individual Contributor (IC) delivers strong results. Healthy work cultures avoid the trap of reserving recognition to extraordinary achievement and adopt a generosity in recognition. In a previous role I held, each of us on the team had a quarterly budget to spend on a fun event and we mostly pooled our budgets together to go on an team building shared experience; they make for great memories and help elevate personal relationships.

## **Critical Feedback**

Despite how welcoming an individual is to receiving feedback, It is a powerful mode of growth for all of us. For that, people managers must continue investing in their direct reports and providing that feedback as needed. Giving feedback, on the other hand, is a skill to master that involves keeping feedback objective, private, balanced with recognition, and delivering it with kindness. 

> feedback is personal for the person receiving it. Most of us pour more time and energy into our work than anything else in our lives. Work is a part of who we are, and so it is personal. — Kim Scott
> 

The point is give feedback on actions, not personality traits. If someone dropped the ball on a large deal, it doesn’t necessarily indicate they’re an underperformer across the board; It only means you need more context and a potential opportunity for coaching. I’ve seen the masters of their fields deliver mediocre product demos or struggle to read the room and say technically incorrect facts at the wrong time. **Everyone will miss here & there**. 

## Build safety

In *Leaders Eat Last*, Simon Sinek explains how safety is our primary engine of progress where managers can create a *Circle of Safety* to enable their people to take risk and perform at their best without fearing retaliation. A successful managers thus provides safety to the team and shields them from organizational bureaucracy. It’s crucial that managers protect their direct reports from stress and time waste, and assure them that they’ll cover their back If they’re venturing into new frontiers. 

One of the major lessons I’ve learned in my Cisco days was when I had a customer complain our wireless equipment was causing intermittent and sporadic outages, when other customers in the thousands did not experience the same technical problem. Matter of fact, I believe they were the only customer globally to face this problem. They’ve contacted our customer support team many times and each time they had to explain to a new engineer their complex situation and history with the problem. Frustrating was at a peak. In response, I had to convince win the minds and hearts of engineers, product managers, and support org leaders to all come together and create a new support workflow we called the *Golden Rule* in Salesforce. The implementation included a banner for the support engineers to read through and acknowledge anytime this customer called, saving them from having to repeat themselves and saving the support engineers from repeated troubleshooting. Getting this solution took months, but the most challenging aspect was convincing three different organizations that the business needed to mature if we were to serve large enterprises at the scale where such one-off technical nuances would take place. In the end, it did end up to be a software bug we collaborated with this customer to resolve after hundreds of hours in defining the problem and reproducing it. I can tell you that the main reason I felt empowered to go knock on so many doors and disturb co-workers higher in the organization was that my director showed my full support. I knew he’s fight for me in case of internal escalations (which did happen!).

Another practice of building safety is blameless post mortems, often practiced in engineering teams. It’s easy to ship insecure or faulty code that accidentally passes CI/CD and QA checks to make it to production, causing product failures. In those cases, cultures that cultivate blameless postmortems allow for all participants across all orgs on the team to speak their true opinion and identify what could have prevented the incident from taking place and allows for learning and growth. With a culture of no blame, you allow your team to color outside the line and experiment freely; which often is a requirement to innovate.

> By creating a Circle of Safety around the people in the organization, leadership reduces the threats people feel inside the group, which frees them up to focus more time and energy to protect the organization from the constant dangers outside and seize the big opportunities. Without a Circle of Safety, people are forced to spend too much time and energy protecting themselves from each other. — Simon Sinek

### Identify the Bright Spots

In *How Minds Change*, David McRaney elaborates on how an analytical mind often gets stuck in analysis paralysis when faced with a challenge, and how a more effective approach is to find areas that have proven successful and overachieving, called `Bright Spots`. To increase efficiencies on your team, look for what’s delivering the best outcomes and evaluate whether there’s a practice or method to adapt widely from there. This falls inline with the software industry practice of *”Ship to Learn” and* the Amazon Leadership principle of “*Bias for Action”*. It’s much easier to make change in iterations rather than a big bang, just as in the *agile* vs. *waterfall* product development methodologies. 

## Hiring

Perhaps the most important task you do in business is hiring the right people. This applies from enterprises to early stage startups. Ensure a new hire is a culture fit, possess the knowledge and expertise the role demands, and the communication and collaboration required for success. Being clear with candidates on what exactly is required for the role and providing them time to ask questions during interview ensures they join with sharp clarity on what’s expected of them.

## **Pitfalls of Management**

Learning how things could go wrong is just as important as learning what matters. In management, there a few pitfalls to watch out for:

- Micro-management: your job as a manager is not to figure out every detail for every direct report or stay involved in the day to day. You are responsible for coaching and developing people to deliver the outcomes you need them to.
- Lacking vulnerability: trust is built with vulnerability. It’s difficult to connect with others without discussing personal matters, in my opinion. Being vulnerable with who you are, what you believe in, what excites you, the life structure you’ve built, and what you are working on. The mutual exchange of what matters personally is the basis for human connection and without that management can be a bit dry. Brene Brown’s research on vulnerability and its application to leadership in *Dare to Lead* has helped bring this specific message to the spotlight.
