A primer on climate change. Bill Gates writes a meticulously researched, data-driven examination  of the challenge in hand and delineates next steps we need to take to resolution. Below I highlight core takeaways:

1. Climate change is caused by greenhouse gases emitted from all around the globe into the atmosphere causing it to heat and increase global temperatures. Carbon dioxide is the most common of these gases, but there are a handful of others that play significant roles, primarily nitrous oxide and methane. For simplicity, all these gases are often combined in a measurement known as *carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2e)*.  

    Molecules with two copies of the same atom —e.g. nitrogen and oxygen— let radiation pass straight through them and only molecules made up of different atoms, the way carbon dioxide and methane are, have the right structure to absorb radiation and start heating up. As of 2021, global emissions of greenhouse gases totaled 51 billion tons annually. Getting to zero indicates finding solutions to balance our emissions back to zero. In a zero-carbon future we would still be producing some emissions but we’ll have technologies to remove emitted carbon.

2. The book breaks down emissions into five sources
    1. How we plug in (energy) — 31%
    2. How we make things (manufacturing) — 27% 
    3. How we grow things (agriculture) — 19%
    4. How we get around (transportation) — 16%
    5. How we keep cool & stay warm — 7%
    
3. Simply setting a goal to reduce emissions, rather than eliminate them entirely, will not be sufficient. There is much we still do not understand about various topics, such as the effect of clouds on warming or the impact of excess heat on ecosystems. We are likely to experience a temperature increase of 1.5 to 3 degrees Celsius by the middle of the century, and 4 to 8 degrees by its end. To put this into perspective, during the ice age, the average temperature was only 6 degrees Celsius lower than it is today.
    
    The global average temperature has already risen by 1 degree Celsius since preindustrial times, with some areas experiencing increases of over 2 degrees Celsius. A rise of 2 degrees Celsius could be significantly worse than a 1.5-degree increase; potentially twice as bad. This could mean twice as many people struggling to access clean water, or a doubling of the reduction in tropical corn production. By 2050, climate change could prove as lethal as COVID-19, and by 2100, it could be five times deadlier.
    
    While scientists debate whether storms are occurring more frequently due to global warming, they generally agree that storms are becoming more powerful. For instance, it has been estimated that Hurricane Maria set back Puerto Rico's infrastructure by over two decades in 2017. As the air becomes warmer and can hold more moisture, it absorbs more water from the soil and plants, increasing the risk of wildfires. Droughts could threaten the Colorado River, which provides drinking water for nearly 40 million people and irrigates over a seventh of all American crops. Corn, which is particularly sensitive to heat and the top crop in the U.S worth over $50 billion annually, could be at risk. In China, where the agricultural system feeds a fifth of the world's population with wheat, rice, and corn, these changes could trigger a regional or even global food crisis.
    
    Rising sea levels are another consequence of global heating, caused both by melting ice and the expansion of seawater as it warms. Research cited by the IPCC suggests that a rise of 2 degrees Celsius could reduce the geographic range of vertebrates by 8%, plants by 16%, and insects by 18%.
    
    Lastly, the human body's ability to cool itself relies on the air's capacity to absorb sweat as it evaporates. If the air cannot absorb sweat, it cannot cool the body, regardless of how much one perspires.
    
4. Our global energy consumption continues to rise due to increasing individual usage and population growth. Daily, people worldwide use more than four billion gallons of oil, a commodity cheaper than Diet Coke. Most zero-carbon solutions are costlier than their fossil-fuel counterparts, partly because fossil fuel prices don't account for their environmental impact, making them appear cheaper. These additional costs are known as *Green Premiums*. The *International Energy Agency (IEA)* estimated that government subsidies for fossil fuel consumption reached $400 billion in 2018.
    
    Climate change impacts will differ by region. All cities will be affected, but coastal cities will suffer the most. Approximately one billion people lack reliable electricity access, with half residing in Sub-Saharan Africa, affecting their ability to refrigerate vaccines.
    
    The most significant energy problem is intermittency, and affordable batteries capable of storing city-sized energy amounts remain unavailable.
    
    In the U.S., experts used a computer model of all power grids to study the feasibility of western states achieving California's 60% renewables goal by 2030, and eastern states reaching New York's 70% clean energy target by the same year. They concluded that enhancing the power grid is necessary for states to meet these goals. America has around 1,000 gigawatts of energy. Offshore wind usage has grown at an average annual rate of 25% over the past three years. In theory, we could generate 2,000 gigawatts from offshore wind, surpassing our current needs.
    
    Nuclear Fission is the only proven large-scale carbon-free energy source capable of reliably delivering power throughout the year, almost anywhere on earth. The U.S. sources approximately 20% of its electricity from nuclear plants, while France, with the world's highest share, gets 70% of its electricity from nuclear energy. In 2008, Gates founded *TerraPower* to design next-generation nuclear reactors. They believe their *traveling wave reactor* design solves key problems. TerraPower's reactor can run on various fuel types, including waste from other nuclear facilities, produce far less waste than current plants, operate fully automated to eliminate human error, and be built underground for protection from attacks.
    
5. Concrete is a versatile material with rust-resistant, rot-proof, and non-flammable properties. The United States alone produces over 96 million tons of cement, a key ingredient in concrete. Steel, another widely-used material, is found in cars, ships, trains, appliances, food cans, and even computers. It is valued for its strength, affordability, durability, and infinite recyclability. The use of steel in America matches that of cement. Plastics and glass are other significant materials. Plastics find versatile applications, while glass is used in windows, jars, bottles, insulation, vehicles, and fiber-optic cables that enable high-speed internet connections. Aluminum is utilized in soda cans, foil, power lines, door knobs, trains, planes, and beer kegs. Fertilizer plays a crucial role in global food production.

    However, the production of these materials contributes significantly to greenhouse gas emissions, accounting for about a third of all emissions worldwide.

    Steel, admired for its strength and malleability when heated, is made from pure iron and carbon. Its production results in approximately 1.8 tons of carbon dioxide per ton of steel. Cement production requires calcium, derived from limestone, and generates an equal amount of carbon dioxide. While cement and steel production inevitably release carbon dioxide, plastic production retains about half of the carbon within the plastic. Nevertheless, plastics may take hundreds of years to degrade.

    To sum up, the path to zero emissions in manufacturing looks like:
    1. Electrify every process possible
    2. Get that electricity from a power grid that’s been decarbonized
    3. Use carbon capture to absorb the remaining emissions
    4. Use materials more efficiently
    
6. Agriculture primarily contributes to global warming through methane, which causes 28 times more warming per molecule than carbon dioxide over a century, and nitrous oxide, which causes 256 times more warming. Nearly a billion cattle worldwide, raised for beef and dairy, produce methane equivalent to the warming effect of 2 billion tons of carbon dioxide annually. This accounts for about 4% of all global emissions.
    
    Currently, there is no practical zero-carbon alternative for fertilizers, nor a carbon capture equivalent for nitrous oxide.
    
    Moreover, soil contains more carbon than the atmosphere and all plant life combined. Removing trees releases stored carbon into the atmosphere as carbon dioxide.
    
    The most vulnerable are the poor, especially farmers who live on the brink and cannot withstand droughts and floods. CGIAR has done significant work in ensuring nutritious food for families, particularly the poorest. CGIAR experts have developed dozens of drought-resistant maize varieties, each tailored for specific African regions.
    
    Thanks to CGIAR's efforts, new drought-tolerant rice varieties are spreading in India, where climate change is causing more dry spells during the rainy season. They have also developed a type of rice, dubbed "scuba" rice, that can survive underwater for two weeks. The Global Commission on Adaptation recommends doubling CGIAR's funding to reach more farmers. Our commission also makes three other recommendations related to agriculture.
    
    1. Help farmers manage the risks from more chaotic weather
    2. Focus on the most vulnerable people
    3. Factor climate change into policy decision. Governments should be coming up with policies and incentives to help farmers reduce their emissions while growing more food at the same time.
     
7. Currently, the best lithium-ion battery available holds 35 times less energy than gasoline, pound for pound. This makes batteries less suitable for long-distance buses and trucks. However, Shenzhen, China — a city of 12 million people— has electrified its entire fleet of over 16,000 buses and nearly two-thirds of its taxis.
    
    A typical diesel truck can travel more than 1,000 miles without refueling. Since we can't electrify cargo trucks, the only viable options today are electrofuels and advanced biofuels. Furthermore, we should consider exploring nuclear-powered container ships, as military submarines and aircraft carriers already use nuclear power.
    
    There are four primary methods to reduce transportation emissions. Firstly, reduce the amount of transportation. Secondly, manufacture cars using fewer carbon-intensive materials. Thirdly, use fuels more efficiently. Lastly, and most effectively, switch to electric vehicles (EVs) and alternative fuels.
     
    
8. Policy plays a vital role in environmental solutions. Since 1990, the U.S. Clean Air Act has led to a 56% decrease in nitrogen dioxide and an 88% decrease in sulfur dioxide in American emissions. Lead has nearly disappeared from American emissions. However, the Act, originally passed in 1970, barely mentioned greenhouse gases. There is a pressing need for new and updated policies.
    
    California has pledged to only purchase electric buses by 2029 and to ban the sale of gas-powered cars by 2035. At the national level, the U.S. has a foundational policy with the Renewable Fuel Standard. Twenty-four states and Puerto Rico have joined the bipartisan U.S. Climate Alliance, committing to the Paris Agreement goals of reducing emissions by at least 26% by 2025. Twelve major American cities aim to be carbon neutral by 2050.
    
    Governments can initiate the process by setting standards in procurement programs and creating labeling programs. These programs inform buyers about the environmental footprint of different suppliers.
    
9. Achieving zero emissions involves directing global passion and scientific intelligence toward deploying existing clean energy solutions and inventing new ones. This will halt further accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Countries that establish successful zero-carbon companies and industries will lead the global economy in the future. For instance, an independent study of the *Human Genome Project (HGP)* found that every $1 the federal government invested in the project generated $141 for the U.S. economy.
    
    Some technologies take decades to become economically efficient. The first Model T, produced by Henry Ford in 1908, achieved only 21 miles per gallon. In contrast, today's leading hybrid car achieves 58 miles per gallon. Solar cells, introduced in the 1970s, originally converted about 15% of sunlight into electricity, but now convert around 25%. Additionally, the price of solar-generated electricity has dropped 90% since 2009.
    
    Innovation is not solely about technology. It's not just about inventing new machines or processes; it also involves developing new business models, supply chains, markets, and policies. These innovations can help bring new inventions to life and scale them globally.
    
10. Five Questions to Ask In Every Climate Conversation
    1. How much of the 51 billion tons are we talking about?
    Focus on funding technologies that could remove at least 500 million tons a year if they’re successful and fully implemented. 
    2. What’s the plan for cement?
    Passenger cars represent less than half of all the emissions from transportation which in turn is 16% of all emissions worldwide. Meanwhile, making steel and cement alone accounts for around 10% of emissions. 
    3. How much power are we talking?
    4. How much space do you need?
    5. How much is this going to cost?
    *Direct Air Capture (DAC)* is an expensive and largely unproven technology but if it works at a large scale it would allow us to capture carbon dioxide no matter when or where it was produced. The one DAC facility now in operation, based in Switzerland, is absorbing gas that might have been spewed out by a coal-fired plant in Texas 10 years ago. 
    Cost of removing a ton of carbon from the air, a figure that hasn’t been firmly established, is at least $200. With some innovation we can realistically expect it to reach $100/ton. The technology behind DAC isn’t ready yet for global deployment and even if it were DAC would be an extremely inefficient method for solving the world’s carbon problem. We’d need to build more than 50,000 DAC plants around the world just to manage the emissions we’re producing right now. In addition, DAC doesn’t work on methane or other greenhouse gases, just carbon dioxide. 
    
11. Innovation is especially needed in the below technologies:
    - Hydrogen produced without emitting carbon
    - Grid-scale electricity storage that can last a full season
    - Electrofuels
    - Advanced biofuels
    - Zero-carbon cement
    - Zero-carbon steel
    - Plant- and cell-based meat and dairy
    - Zero-carbon fertilizer
    - Next-generation nuclear fission
    - Nuclear fusion
    - Carbon capture (both direct and point)
    - Underground electricity transmission
    - Zero-carbon plastics
    - Geothermal energy
    - Pumped hydro
    - Thermal storage
    - Drought- and flood- tolerant food crops
    - Zero-carbon alternatives to palm oil
    - Coolants that don’t contain F-gases
    
    The demand side is a bit more complex than the supply side. It involves two steps: the proof phase and the scale-up phase. Currently, ideas in the proof phase include low-carbon cement, next-generation nuclear fission, carbon capture and sequestration, offshore wind, cellulosic ethanol (an advanced biofuel), and meat alternatives. Meanwhile, onshore wind, solar power, and electric vehicles are in the scale-up phase.
    

12. To summarize; First, make it a goal to get to zero —by 2050 for rich countries and as soon as or after 2050 as possible for middle-income countries. Second, develop specific plans for meeting those goals. To get to zero by 2050, we’ll need to have the policy and market structures in place by 2030. And third, any country that’s in a position to fund research needs to make sure it’s on track to make energy so cheap —to reduce the Green Premiums so much— that middle-income countries will be able to get to zero.
